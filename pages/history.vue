          We are a 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization. P.O.S.S.E. began in 1998,
          when Marlena’s son, Michael, was diagnosed with a severe reading
          disability known as Dyseidetic, Dysphonetic Dyslexia. This is a
          learning challenge that affects children both visually and auditorily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Michael was in the second grade and was fortunate enough to have a
          teacher who noticed that he had special academic needs. The teacher
          admitted to not knowing the appropriate services to help him, but knew
          that it was imperative that he required academic help. Discouraged by
          lack of guidance from the school district and her son’s feelings of
          failure, she was left, through trial and error, to close the
          educational gap and make certain that the appropriate learning
          programs and remediation for her son’s needs were implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a parent, she witnessed first-hand the agony, struggles and
          sleepless nights and days of “living” at his school to ensure that his
          educational needs were met. For more than a decade the family had
          struggled with academic challenges that seemed almost insurmountable
          at times. The maze they traveled for academic success resulted in a
          strong desire to make the road easier for other families in similar
          situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          P.O.S.S.E was birth from Michael's dream that no child should
          experience what he did. Every child deserves to enjoy their younger
          years at school and have the everlasting memories of success. Out of
          this P.O.S.S.E. was created.

          A Learning Disability does not define our children. It is a term used
          under I.D.E.A. [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act] With the
          appropriate support, intervention and remediation children with
          learning challenges will achieve success in school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hidden Disabilities is a term referring to a child that appears
          intelligent; however, the child is unable to demonstrate the skill
          level expected from a child of a similar age. Invisible Disability, or
          Hidden Disability, is an umbrella term that captures a whole spectrum
          of hidden disabilities or challenges that are primarily neurological
          in nature. Invisible disability, or hidden disability are defined as
          disabilities that are not immediately apparent. A child that appears
          intelligent; however, the child is unable to demonstrate the skill
          level expected from a child of a similar age, may have a hidden
          disability or invisible disability.

          Various learning challenges include: Dyscalculia affects a child's
          ability to understand numbers in math; Dysgraphia affects a child's
          handwriting ability and fine motor skills; Dyslexia affects reading
          and related language-based processing skills; Nonverbal learning
          challenges are when a child has trouble interpreting nonverbal cues
          such as a facial expression or body language and may have poor
          coordination; Oral/Written Language Disorder and Specific Reading
          Comprehension Deficit affects a child's understanding of what they are
          reading or of spoken language.. Dyspraxia is a neurological (or
          brain-based) disorder that impacts a child’s ability relating to gross
          motor skills, motor planning and coordination.
        </p>
        <p>
          ADHD [Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder] is a treatable,
          neurodevelopmental disorder. Symptoms include: difficulty for a child
          to stay focused or pay attention causing the child to have difficulty
          controlling their behavior and exhibiting hyperactivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Executive Functioning Disorder is critical because it helps our
          children prioritize their tasks. Executive Functioning Disorder is a
          set of mental skills that include working memory, flexible thinking,
          and self-control. We use these skills everyday to learn, work, and
          manage daily life. Executive Functioning Disorder causes the child to
          have difficulty focusing, following directions, managing emotions and
          completing tasks.
