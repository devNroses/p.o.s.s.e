          <h3>Start Journey</h3>
          <p>
            Parents of Students in Special Education (P.O.S.S.E., Inc.) is an
            independent, nonprofit, §501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization of
            parents, educational professionals, doctors, attorneys and, special
            educational advocates. P.O.S.S.E. began in 1998, when Marlena’s son,
            Michael, was diagnosed with a severe reading disability known as
            Dyseidetic, Dysphonetic Dyslexia. This is a learning disability that
            affects children both visually and auditorily.<br />
            Michael was in the second grade and was fortunate enough to have a
            teacher who noticed that he had special academic needs. The teacher
            admitted to not knowing the appropriate services to help him, but
            knew that it was imperative that he required academic help.

          <h3>Signs of Struggle</h3>
          <p>
            Discouraged by lack of guidance from the school district and her
            son’s feelings of failure, she was left, through trial and error, to
            close the education gap and make certain that the appropriate
            learning programs and remediation for her son’s needs were
            implemented. He is preparing to enter Berklee School of Music in
            Boston.<br /><br />
            She witnessed first-hand the agony, struggles and sleepless nights
            and days of “living” at his school to ensure that his educational
            needs were met. For more than a decade the family had struggled with
            academic challenges that seemed almost insurmountable at times.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Beinging of P.O.S.S.E</h3>
          <p>
            The maze they traveled for academic success resulted in a strong
            desire to make the road easier for other families in similar
            situations. Michael’s dream was for his mother to help other
            children not have to experience the frustration, struggles that he
            had to endure through his educational journey but to be able to
            enjoy their younger years at school and have that everlasting memory
            of school to pass onto their children. Michael wanted me to put this
            in Motion -- Thus, P.O.S.S.E. was formed.

        <h2>CHARACTERIZING LEARNING DISABILITES</h2>
        <p>
          A Learning Disability cannot be cured or fixed; it is a lifelong
          challenge. However, with the appropriate support, intervention and
          remediation children with learning disabilities can achieve success in
          school. “Learning Disabilities” is an “umbrella” term describing a
          number of other, more specific learning disabilities, such as dyslexia
          and dysgraphia. This is why learning disabilities are referred to as
          “hidden disabilities”: the child looks perfectly “normal” and seems to
          be a very bright and intelligent child, yet may be unable to
          demonstrate the skill level expected from a child of a similar age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some types of Learning Disabilities: Dyscalculia affects a child’s
          ability to understand numbers in math; Dysgraphia affects a child’s
          handwriting ability and fine more skills; Dyslexia affects reading and
          related language-based processing skills; Nonverbal Learning
          Disabilities a child has trouble interpreting nonverbal cues like
          facial expressions or body language and may have poor coordination;
          Oral/Written Language Disorder and Specific Reading Comprehension
          Deficit affects a child’s understanding what they read or of spoken
          language; ADHD is hard for a child to stay focused and paying
          attention, controlling behavior and hyperactivity; Dyspraxia causes
          problems with movement and coordination language and speech; Executive
          Functioning affects planning, organization attention to details and
          managing.
